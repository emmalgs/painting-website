#### _A website portfolio to show my paintings and art_

## Technologies Used

## Description

This is my first rendition of my painting website. The homepage randomly selects a painting to display. Currently working on displaying the images in the painting section and UI to cycle through painting images on a carousel.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone repo to your desktop
* Navigate to the top of the directory
* Open index.html in your browser

## Known Bugs

* _WIP_
* _Would like to have individual painting pages to highlight each painting with it's info_
* _Also would like to include my drawings and writing_
* _Lastly, I'd like to display my sculptures on a page_
* _And it also still needs Bio CV and Contact!_
